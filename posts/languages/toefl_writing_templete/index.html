<p>Madagascar, a large island about 400 kilometers off the coast of Africa, is home to many mammals that exist nowhere else on Earth. Genetic evidence shows that the ancestors of these mammals arrived there from the African mainland between 60 million and 20 million years ago. According to a popular theory, the ancestor species crossed the 400 kilometers by riding debris like logs or branches floating on the ocean. However, there are serious problems with that theory.</p>
<p>First, land mammals normally cross the sea only by accident. For example, a few animals might be swept into the water by a big storm and then somehow stay <u-r>afloat</u-r> on logs or plants. That does not happen frequently. In addition, in order to reproduce and establish a population in the new location, several individuals of the same species would have to make the crossing together——an even rarer accident. It seems <u-r>implausible</u-r> that such accidental events could happen often enough to give rise to the large and diverse mammalian fauna of Madagascar.</p>
<p>Second, the sea currents near the mainland African coast where the mammals supposedly came from do not flow toward Madagascar. Even if some animals were thrown into the water by storms and were able to float on debris, the currents would carry them away from Madagascar.</p>
<p>Third, a 400-kilometer journey would have taken too long for animals to survive. Scientists estimate that the trip takes three weeks. It is impossible to float over the ocean for that long without any sources of food or freshwater. The animals that were washed out to sea would have died of hunger or thirst before reaching the new location.</p>

<p>Now listen to part of a lecture on the topic you just read about.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s reconsider the reasons that the reading disagreed with the theory. Once you know the whole story, you&rsquo;ll see that those reasons are not convincing. It seems very likely that the theory is correct. The animals did float to Madagascar. First, new genetic research has revealed a surprising result. All the mammal species that currently live on the island of Madagascar are descended from just four ancestor species, so only four species had to accidentally cross the sea from the African continent to Madagascar. That&rsquo;s just forced successful crossings in the course of what was it 40 million years, right? So even though crossings like this are unusual for crossings could have happened in such a long period of time, even unusual events will occur a few times. Second about the sea currents, although the sea currents may not flow toward Madagascar today, we have to ask what the situation was. Millions of years ago, computer models show us that 60 million years ago, Africa and Madagascar were a bit further south than they are now at that location, further to the south, the sea currents flowed differently than they do at the present location. They flowed toward Madagascar, so the currents could have brought the animals to the island at that time. Third, animals would not necessarily have died of thirst or starvation during the trip. Some mammals have the ability to slow down their metabolism by entering into a state called <u-r>torpor</u-r>. While in this state they do not need to eat or drink. Since their metabolism is at very low levels, the mammals on Madagascar belong to groups that experience torpor, so it&rsquo;s likely their ancestors could have survived the 3 week trip from mainland Africa.</p>
<p><strong>示例范文：</strong></p>
<p>The lecture <c-b>addresses and counters</c-b> the arguments presented in the reading passage against the theory that mammals reached Madagascar by floating on debris. (点明主题) First, the lecture <c-b>introduces new genetic evidence indicating</c-b> that all current mammalian species on Madagascar descended from just four ancestor species. This significantly reduces the number of necessary successful crossings, making the theory more plausible over a 40-million-year period.
Second, <c-b>it challenges the argument about</c-b> sea currents being unfavorable by suggesting that millions of years ago, Africa and Madagascar&rsquo;s geographical positions meant currents flowed differently, likely towards Madagascar, supporting the idea of accidental crossings.
Lastly, <c-b>regarding</c-b> the survival challenge during such a journey, the lecture explains some mammals can enter a state of torpor, drastically reducing their metabolic needs. This adaptation could enable survival during the three-week journey without food or water, directly addressing the concerns about dehydration and starvation raised in the reading text.</p>

<p>Most people believe that the first airplane was built and flown in 1903 by brothers Orville and Wilbur Wright. Yet there is some evidence that another inventor, Gustave Whitehead, may have built and flown an airplane in 1901, two years before the Wright brothers.</p>
<p>Many critics, however, think that the evidence that Whitehead flew the first airplane has significant weaknesses.</p>
<p>First, Whitehead&rsquo;s alleged flight was reported by several newspapers in 1901. The newspaper reports do not seem very trustworthy, however. For example, none of the newspaper articles printed a photograph of the airplane in flight; the articles included only drawings of Whitehead&rsquo;s airplane. The lack of photographs suggests that the flight never actually occurred. In fact, journalists of that period sometimes invented exciting stories like this one to get people to buy more newspapers.</p>
<p>Second, the design of Whitehead&rsquo;s airplane makes many experts doubt that it was capable of flight. Because early airplanes could not move as fast as today&rsquo;s planes do, most had two or three levels of wings to provide enough lift to permit the plane to rise off the ground. Whitehead&rsquo;s airplane was unique in this regard, having only one level of wings. With only a single set of wings and a relatively low flying speed, Whitehead&rsquo;s airplane seems unlikely to have got off the ground.</p>
<p>Third, it is also doubtful that the engine that Whitehead used in his airplane functioned well. In the early 1900s Whitehead built a number of aircraft engines that he sold to other aircraft builders, but many of those builders failed to build functional airplanes. This poor success record brings his ability to build a functioning engine for his 1901 plane into serious doubt.</p>

<p>Now listen to part of a lecture on the topic you just read about.</p>
<p>The evidence that Gustave Whitehead was the first person to fly an airplane is actually much stronger than the critics believe.</p>
<p>I can respond to each argument you read in the passage.</p>
<p>First, newspaper articles about Whitehead&rsquo;s successful flight cannot be dismissed simply because there were no photographs accompanying the articles. The reason that many newspapers at the time still use drawings was that the quality of photographs available to them varied greatly. Many available photographs just would not look good in print, and it&rsquo;s likely that any photograph of Whitehead&rsquo;s flight would have been of poor quality. The flight took place very early in the morning when the light was very dim and, of course, the airplane was a relatively fast moving object, so it would have been difficult to capture a good quality image with the types of cameras that were in use in 1901.</p>
<p>Second, about the design of Whitehead&rsquo;s airplane. A few years ago, a group of researchers set out to test whether the design could work. They actually built and tested a full sized copy of whitehead&rsquo;s airplane. It was a pretty accurate copy of Whitehead&rsquo;s airplane based closely on his diagrams, and guess what? It flew successfully. This modern experiment shows that Whitehead&rsquo;s original design could have worked.</p>
<p>Third, the idea that Whitehead was a bad engine builder. It&rsquo;s true that some other airplanes that used Whitehead&rsquo;s engines were not successful, but we cannot necessarily blame Whitehead&rsquo;s engines for that. You see, these were the early days of airplane building. Many airplane builders did not really know what they were doing. They did not have the right airplane designs, so even with a good engine, many of those builders were not able to build a functioning plane. Actually, the fact that the builders wanted to buy Whitehead&rsquo;s engines suggests that the engines were reliable and of good quality. So this argument is not very convincing.</p>

<p><strong>Firstly</strong>, the absence of photographs in the newspaper reports <c-b>is defended by</c-b> explaining the poor quality and impracticality of photography at that time, especially under dim light conditions and with a fast-moving subject like an airplane. This suggests that drawings were a reasonable alternative and does not inherently <c-b>discredit</c-b> the reports of Whitehead&rsquo;s flight.</p>
<p><strong>Secondly</strong>, regarding the design of Whitehead&rsquo;s airplane, the lecturer <c-b>highlights</c-b> a recent experiment where researchers built and successfully flew a replica based on Whitehead&rsquo;s designs. <c-b>This refutes the reading passage&rsquo;s claim that</c-b> the single-wing design was incapable of flight, <c-b>demonstrating that</c-b> it was indeed viable.</p>
<p><strong>Lastly</strong>, <c-b>the lecture challenges the assertion that</c-b> Whitehead’s engines were ineffective by pointing out that the failures of other aircraft using his engines could have resulted from poor design by other builders and not Whitehead’s engines. The demand for his engines among early airplane builders <c-b>actually indicates</c-b> their perceived quality and reliability, <c-b>undermining the doubts cast over</c-b> Whitehead&rsquo;s engineering skills in the reading passage.</p>

<p>A recent disease has caused sea star populations along the western coast of North America to die in large numbers. Known as <p-y>sea star wasting disease</p-y>, it spreads quickly and has wiped out whole communities of sea stars in some locations. Researchers do not know what causes sea star wasting disease, but several different theories are being considered.</p>
<p>Parasites</p>
<p>One possible cause is a small parasite, an organism that attaches itself to sea stars and negatively affects their health. The parasite spreads rapidly from sea star to sea star through the water. Researchers linked this parasite to some previous die-offs of sea stars, and some believe it may be responsible for the current outbreak as well.</p>
<p>Bacteria</p>
<p>Another theory is that the wasting disease is caused by harmful bacteria carried by shellfish, the sea stars&rsquo;food source. An experiment was conducted that supports this idea. In the experiment,sea stars kept in tanks of seawater were fed fresh shellfish collected from the ocean nearby. The sea stars got the disease, suggesting that the shellfish transmitted dangerous bacteria to the sea stars.</p>
<p>Water Temperature</p>
<p>Finally, rising water temperatures could be responsible for the recent outbreak. In recent years,seawater temperatures have risen in many areas of the world, including the western coast of North America. High temperatures weaken the sea star&rsquo;s immune system, so it is possible that higher water temperatures may be responsible for the massive die-off.</p>

<p>Now listen to part of a lecture on the topic you just read about.</p>
<p>Each of the theories you read about has a serious weakness. It seems that the real cause of the wasting disease and sea stars is still a mystery.</p>
<p>First, the parasite you read about infect sea stars only during their reproductive season. The period of the year that the sea stars used to breed. That makes sense because the parasite spreads by attaching itself to the reproductive organs of sea stars. However, the wasting disease that we&rsquo;re discussing spreads among sea stars. The whole year round, not just during their reproductive season, given that the wasting disease spreads throughout the whole year, it cannot, because by the parasite.</p>
<p>Second, the theory about bacteria carried by shellfish has problems, too. You see when researchers analyzed the shellfish used in the experiment, they found that they carried only types of bacteria that sea stars had always been able to tolerate those bacteria had never made sea stars sick before they had always been quite harmless to see stars. So the wasting disease observed in the experiment was probably not caused by these bacteria, but by some other unknown factor.</p>
<p>Third to evaluate the theory about rising water temperatures, scientists tried to take a closer look at where exactly the disease occurs, and they found that the wasting disease occurs quite frequently in areas where water temperature has remained constant and has not risen at all so that contradicts the temperature theory.</p>
<p>The scientists actually discovered something else. The disease often occurs in areas of the ocean where the water is very <strong>calm</strong>. Sea stars living in areas with strong waves do not get sick very often. It looks like the disease is spreading mainly in calm waters, regardless of water temperature, but the reason for that is still mysterious.</p>
<p>Summarize the points made in the lecture. Being sure to explain how they challenge the specific theories presented in the reading passage.</p>

<p><c-b>The reading and listening discuss why</c-b> sea star population declines. <c-b>The reading points out three reasons to explain why</c-b> sea star population declines. <c-b>Whereas, the professor totally refutes the three points presented in the passage</c-b>. (主题句)</p>
<p>Firstly, the professor <c-b>rebuts the reading’s first point that</c-b> the parasite attachés itself to sea star, and thus affects star’s health. He points out that this parasite only affects star’s reproductive organ and thus only affects star in its reproductive season. But disease appears during the whole season.</p>
<p><c-b>According to the reading material</c-b>, the bacteria in the shellfish, which is the food of sea star, cause sea star decline. <c-b>The professor mentions that</c-b> for most sea stars, they can tolerate bacteria, so this bacterium is harmless to sea star. <c-b>Therefore</c-b>, there must be another reason to cause sea star decline.</p>
<p>At last, <c-b>reading material points out that</c-b> water temperature rising weakens the sea star’s immune system. However, the professor explains that the water temperature in area where the disease outbreaks is quite <strong>moderate</strong>.</p>
<p>Besides, the disease outbreaks in the area, where the water wave is much calmer than other areas; the reason is still in mystery.</p>

<p>Since the common carp was introduced to Australian waters about two centuries ago, it has become an invasive species in many Australian waterways, where it competes with native fish and harms local ecosystems. Scientists are currently investigating several methods for reducing carp numbers in order to improve ecosystems in Australia.</p>
<p>First, it is possible to reduce carp populations through commercial fishing. In the United States,for instance, the Asian carp has been a harmful invasive species for many years, but its numbers have been reduced in several areas by increased commercial fishing. This occurred because government programs encouraged commercial fisheries to catch and sell more carp and because carp was promoted as a fish that is especially good to eat. Commercial carp fishing could similarly be encouraged in Australia to reduce carp populations.</p>
<p>Another option is to poison the carp. Bait food injected with a powerful toxin can be thrown into lakes and ponds; carp that eat these baits will die. To keep native fish species from being killed by these poisoned baits, they can be made attractive only to carp. Unlike many fish, carp can eat plants and are attracted to certain kinds of plant material, like corn. So, if the poisoned baits are made of corn or resemble corn, they will only get eaten by the carp, and only the carp will get killed by the poison.</p>
<p>A final option involves genetic engineering. In the laboratory, scientists have found a way to modify or change individual carps&rsquo;genes so that they ohly produce male offspring, without producing any females. Scientists hope to introduce such genetically modified carp into the infested waterways, where they will breed with the carp that are already present. As these modified carp spread their genes throughout the carp population, carp offspring will increasingly be male, reducing the number of carp eggs that get produced.</p>

<p>Now listen to part of a lecture on the topic you just read about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unlikely that any of the strategies you&rsquo;ve read about will provide a good solution to the car problem in Australia.</p>
<p>First, it&rsquo;s unlikely that commercial fishing of carbon in Australia can be increased significantly as it was in the united states. This is because, unlike the carp in the united states, the common carp in Australia isn&rsquo;t really caught for human consumption. The thing is the common carp in Australia doesn&rsquo;t even taste very good. In fact, the common carp is really only caught commercially in Australia to make food for farm animals because it&rsquo;s rich in protein. But the demand for carp to make food for farm animals is already being met in australia. It&rsquo;s unlikely to increase significantly any time soon.</p>
<p>Second, despite precautions that can be taken, this bait program probably will end up killing native fish species. The problem is, carp have an extremely good sense of smell. They can detect toxins and will often refuse to eat bait that&rsquo;s been poisoned. This means that poisoned bates, placed in the water, will stay in the water and eventually their toxins may leak into the water and poison native fish. So using poisoned bait probably will hurt the native fish we want to protect but won&rsquo;t significantly reduce carp numbers.</p>
<p>Finally, the problem with introducing genetically modified carp to stop carp reproduction is that healthy carp will still manage to get into lakes and streams. You see in Australia, some colorful varieties of carp are very popular as pets. Many australians keep these pet carp in artificial ponds in their backyards. Unfortunately, flooding from heavy rains sometimes allows these pet carp to escape from backyard ponds into nearby waterways. Once in the wild, these pet carp breed with invasive carp, introducing healthy genes back into the population. As a result, female carp continued to be produced and keep car populations high by laying lots of eggs.</p>
<p>Summarize the points made in the lecture. Being sure to explain how they challenged the specific solutions presented in the reading passage.</p>

<p>Water passages known as canals can help reduce the amount of time it takes a ship to travel between locations. <u-r>The Panama Canal 巴拿马运河</u-r>, in Central America, is currently used for much of the shipping of goods between Asia and the East Coast of the United States. Even so, since at least the mid-1800s, there has been interest in constructing a canal through another location in Central America; <u-r>Nicaragua 尼加拉瓜</u-r>, to the north of the Panama Canal, has long been proposed as a site for this canal. There are several reasons why some people support this proposal.</p>
<p>First, a canal through Nicaragua would facilitate faster transport of goods between Asia and the East Coast of the United States. Ships coming from Asia have to travel farther south to reach the Panama Canal than they would to reach a canal in Nicaragua. Building a canal through Nicaragua would cut about 500 <u-r>nautical</u-r> miles off the journey between Asia and the East Coast of the United States.</p>
<p>Second, a canal through Nicaragua could allow for the transit of larger ships. As global trade over long distances grows in importance, shipping companies may try to increase efficiency by constructing larger freighter ships. The Panama Canal can handle ships carrying up to approximately 13,000 containers of goods. A canal through Nicaragua could be designed to accommodate ships that can carry several thousand more containers of goods at a time.</p>
<p>Third, a canal through Nicaragua would be an opportunity to improve the environment. The builders of the canal have committed to compensate for environmental disruption caused by construction. For example, in order to offset the removal of trees in the path of the canal, the builders have agreed to plant a large number of trees in areas disrupted by the construction. In addition,they are also planning to replace trees in areas of Nicaragua where deforestation is already an extensive problem. These efforts to repair environmental damage will make significant improvements to the land.</p>

<p>Now listen to part of a lecture on the topic you just read about.</p>
<p>Each of the reasons given in the passage for constructing a canal through Nicaragua has shortcomings.</p>
<p>First, about the faster transport of goods, it is true that the distance that ships would have to cover on the open seas between Asia and the east coast of the United States would be significantly reduced. But the problem is that ships going through Nicaragua would have to spend more time passing through the canal itself. That&rsquo;s because the country of Nicaragua was much wider than Panama. In fact, a canal built across Nicaragua would be more than three times longer than the Panama canal. Ships moving through a canal move very slowly and so any time gained by ships and covering this distance on the open seas would be lost in passing through the Nicaragua canal itself.</p>
<p>Second, it is not clear that a canal, Nicaragua could consistently allow for larger ships to pass through, for this to happen, water levels in all parts of the canal need to be relatively high. Currently, proposals for the canal include building it through lake Nicaragua, the largest lake in the region. But during droughts, the water level of lake Nicaragua becomes very low and low water levels in lake Nicaragua, meaning that sometimes the water level will be too low for larger ships to pass through.</p>
<p>Third, reforestation will not likely be enough to compensate for all the environmental disruption caused by building the canal across Nicaragua. Nicaragua is an ecologically diverse country, with several different types of ecosystems and almost all of them will be altered by the construction of the canal. For example, the area affected by the canal construction contains different types of wetlands, each with its own distinct ecosystem of plants and animals. With this much diversity, it would be difficult to effectively measure the harm done to the environment, and nearly impossible to attempt to repair the damage.</p>

<p><c-b>The lecture challenges each of the reasons presented in the reading passage for</c-b> constructing a canal through Nicaragua. (观点句) First, although a Nicaraguan canal might reduce sea travel distance, <c-b>this benefit is offset by</c-b> the significant increase in time ships would spend traversing the <c-b>substantially longer</c-b> canal compared to Panama’s, <c-b>negating</c-b> any time savings.

<p>Several species of <p-y>cypress trees</p-y>, which can grow in wetlands and shallow water, produce unusual structures called knees. Unlike roots, cypress knees grow above the ground. They are strange formations that extend upward from the trees&rsquo;roots into the air. While the function of roots is well established, the function of knees is still unclear, but scientists have several hypotheses.</p>
<p>Oxygen absorption</p>
<p>First, knees may help the trees&rsquo;roots absorb or take in oxygen. Plant roots require oxygen for important cellular functions, and the soil in the watery habitats where cypress trees often grow is low in oxygen. Roots of plants growing in low-oxygen soil must often obtain oxygen from another source. For example, mangrove trees, which also grow in soil that is underwater, are known for having above-ground roots that absorb oxygen. Like the roots of mangroves, cypress knees may take in oxygen from the air and deliver it to the deeper roots.</p>
<p>Additional stability</p>
<p>Second, knees may help cypress trees stand firmly in the soil, making them better able to remain securely in place when exposed to high winds or strong water currents. The fact that the cypress has knees in addition to a network of roots may provide additional stability, allowing the tree to anchor itself well in the soil. Cypress trees may need this additional support due to the softness of the wet soil in which they grow.</p>
<p>Methane release</p>
<p>Finally, knees grow on trees in areas where methane gas exists in the soil. The knees are in direct contact with the soil infused with methane, which is of no use to trees. Therefore, the function of knees may be to release methane gas from the trees&rsquo;roots into the air. The fact that measurable amounts of methane have been detected in the air above the knees supports this idea.</p>

<p>Now listen to part of a lecture on the topic you just read about.</p>
<p>You read about 3 possible functions of cypress knees, but all of these hypotheses are <c-b>problematic</c-b>.</p>
<p>First, it seems reasonable that a structure is sticking up into the air would help absorb or take in oxygen. The researchers tested this hypothesis. They placed cypress knees in tightly closed containers with oxygen and measured how the oxygen levels inside the containers changed over time. Surprisingly, they found that the oxygen levels did not change much. This indicated that the knees absorbed very little oxygen. If the function of cypress knees were to take an oxygen, you would expect the knees to absorb significant amounts of the oxygen in the containers. That did not happen.</p>
<p>Second, the idea that knees help cypress trees stay firmly rooted in the soil is problematic, too. You see many cypress knees are attached to the cypress&rsquo;s horizontal roots. Those horizontal roots do not extend down deep into the soil and the knee does not provide any additional stability in that situation. Knees can&rsquo;t help with stability only if they&rsquo;re attached to vertical roots that reach deep into the soil. But many knees are not connected to vertical roots at all. Since the knees are so frequently attached to horizontal roots rather than to vertical ones, it&rsquo;s doubtful that physical support is their main purpose.</p>
<p>Finally, about methane release. This idea is unconvincing for a couple of reasons. You see, although methane is not useful to trees, it really does them no harm. It seems unlikely that the trees would develop special features like the knees just to get rid of something that has no negative effect. Besides, lots of microorganisms live on cypress knees, and it&rsquo;s completely possible that these time new organisms produce the methane detected around the knees, not the knees themselves.</p>
<p>Summarize the points made in the lecture，being sure to explain how they cast out on the specific theories mentioned in the reading passage.</p>
<p><strong>示例范文：</strong></p>
<p>The lecture challenges the three functions of cypress knees proposed in the reading. First, an experiment involving cypress knees in sealed containers showed minimal oxygen absorption, <c-b>contradicting the theory that</c-b> knees significantly help in oxygen intake. Second, <c-b>the stability hypothesis is questioned as</c-b> many knees are attached to horizontal, not vertical roots, making it <c-b>unlikely</c-b> that knees provide significant stabilization in soft soil. Finally, the methane release theory is doubted as methane does not harm trees, and detected methane might actually be produced by microorganisms living on the knees, not the knees themselves. <c-b>These points cast doubt on</c-b> the proposed functions of cypress knees.</p>

<p>An intriguing underwater rock structure exists off the coast of Japan. Since the discovery of the rock formation in the 1980s, archaeologists and geologists have debated whether the structure is the result of natural processes or of human construction. Several scholars have argued that it was made by humans based on several pieces of evidence.</p>
<p><u>Ancient Civilization</u></p>
<p>First, there is evidence that an ancient civilization was present in the region around 10,000 years ago. At that time, the sea level was lower, and the structure would have been on dry land. Recent expeditions to the area have uncovered bones, pottery fragments, and parts of tools that are many thousands of years old. With this archaeological evidence, it&rsquo;s reasonable to hypothesize that ancient people living around the structure could have carved it when the area was not yet underwater.</p>
<p><u>Features Designed for Human Use</u></p>
<p>Second, pictures of the structure reveal features that seem to be intended for human use (see illustration). For example, there is a section that appears to be a wide, flat platform with stairs along its sides, as well as several large rock pieces that are likely walls. The presence of stairs and walls suggests that the structure was made for human use and was built by humans. Based on such features, some archaeologists have proposed that the whole structure may be a remnant of an ancient city.</p>
<p><u>Straight Edges</u></p>
<p>Finally, the rock from the structure has very straight, clear edges. If the rocky structure had been created by a natural process such as water erosion, its edges would be round. There are also several rock elements that intersect at sharp 90-degree angles. These straight edges and angles suggest that the rock was carved by humans rather than byewaves and currents of the ocean, which would have left gentler curved edges.</p>

<p>Now listen to part of a lecture on the topic you just read about.</p>
<p>Actually, many scholars doubt that the Japanese rock formation was carved by humans rather than by nature. Here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>First, it&rsquo;s true that an ancient people lived in the area when the structure was on dry land, but would that civilization really have been capable of building something like this? The best way to know is to look at their tools, and the ancient artifacts found in the area do not include any large tools like stone axes that would have been needed to carve the structure. In fact, the oldest large tools researchers found in this region of japan were from a much later period when the rock structure itself was underwater. Without large tools. An ancient civilization would not have been able to build this structure.</p>
<p>Second, what about the features seemingly designed for human use, such as stairs? Well, a closer look at those features tells a different story. Remember the picture of the so called stairs with a human diver swimming next to them. If you compare the size of the diver with the size of the so called stairs, it&rsquo;s clear that each stare is as much as a meter high, which would make the stairs much too large to walk up comfortably. A person would have to jump from one stair to the next. No one would design a feature like this for human use. Therefore, we&rsquo;re likely seeing naturally formed features that only look like things humans create.</p>
<p>Finally, it&rsquo;s true that the straight edges rule out a process like water erosion. But a different natural process may be responsible. The structure is made of a rock called sandstone. When sandstone is put under pressure, it breaks in the straight lines and does not leave rough uneven edges. This area experiences frequent earthquakes, an earthquake could have easily caused the sandstone to break, which would explain all the straight edges we see in the structure.</p>
<p>So the formation couldn&rsquo;t have been made naturally <c-b>after all</c-b>.</p>
<p>Summarize the points made in the lecture. Being sure to explain how they cast doubt on the specific points made in the reading passage.</p>

<p><c-b>The lecture counters the reading passage&rsquo;s claims about</c-b> the Japanese underwater rock formation being man-made.

<p>In 2012 the remains (bones) of a man were discovered at the site of a former church in England. Certain features suggested that these remains belonged to Richard III, who died in 1485——the last English king killed in battle. Many historians were excited by the possibility that Richard III&rsquo;s remains had been discovered after so many centuries.</p>
<p>However, new evidence indicates that these remains cannot be those of Richard III.</p>
<p>First, the man&rsquo;s hair color seems incorrect for Richard III. DNA evidence recovered from the remains showed that the man had DNA associated with blond hair. However, Richard III is depicted as a man with brown hair in all of his existing portraits, making it doubtful that the remains belong to Richard III.</p>
<p>Second, the remains seem to be too old to be those of Richard III. Researchers used a technique called <u-r>radiocarbon dating</u-r> to examine the level of radioactive carbon in the remains and thus determine how old the bones were. This dating revealed that the remains were from a man who died in the first half of the fifteenth century. Since Richard III died in the second half of the fifteenth century, in 1485, the remains are too old to be those of the English king.</p>
<p>Finally, the remains did not show any signs of wounds or injuries, except the fatal ones at the time of the man&rsquo;s death. Richard III was an experienced military commander who had been in many battles and had been involved in dangerous fighting. Therefore, his remains would likely contain marks on the bones of healed wounds from his previous battles. However, the remains of the man found in the church showed no evidence of healed wounds.</p>

<p>Now listen to part of a lecture on the topic you just read about:</p>
<p>In fact, most historians still believe that the remains are those of Richard III. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>
<p>First, the DNA evidence: What DNA can tell us for sure is someone&rsquo;s hair color as a child. What it cannot tell us is whether that person&rsquo;s hair remained blonde. It sometimes happens that people who have DNA for blonde hair have blonde hair only as children, but then their hair becomes darker during <u-r>adolescence</u-r>. The same seems to have been true for Richard III. As a child, he may have had blonde hair that became darker later in his life, as shown in his portraits.</p>
<p>Second, the remains aren&rsquo;t as old as the radiocarbon dating suggested. You see, we can tell from the man&rsquo;s teeth that he ate lots of fish and other seafood. And it so happens that humans who eat a lot of seafood have lower levels of radioactive carbon in their bones than we’d expect to see. And these lower levels of radioactive carbon make the bones appear to be older than they really are. Understanding this, researchers have now established that the remains are not as old as they first appeared to be. They were instead from a man who likely died late in the 15th century, which just happens to be when Richard III died.</p>
<p>Finally, despite Richard III&rsquo;s involvement in battles, it&rsquo;s possible that he was never wounded in any of those battles. As a member of the royal family, Richard III probably wore the best armor——special protective clothing available at the time. This armor would have protected him quite well in battle, and at most, he would have received only minor injuries, such as skin bruises, and those injuries would not have left any marks on his bones. So it&rsquo;s not surprising that the remains showed no evidence of healed wounds from his old battles.</p>
<p>Summarize the points made in the lecture, being sure to explain how they challenge the specific points made in the reading passage.</p>
<p><strong>示例范文：</strong></p>
<p><c-b>The lecture challenges the claims made in the reading passage regarding</c-b> the identity of the remains found at a former church in England, believed to be those of Richard III. (主题句)
Firstly, <c-b>it counters the hair color inconsistency argument by explaining that</c-b> DNA only indicates childhood hair color, which can darken over time, suggesting Richard III may indeed have had blond hair that turned brown as he aged. Secondly, <c-b>regarding the age of the bones, the lecture disputes</c-b> the radiocarbon dating results by highlighting the impact of a seafood-heavy diet on radioactive carbon levels in bones, which could falsely suggest a greater age, aligning the man&rsquo;s death closer to Richard III’s time. Finally, the absence of healed battle wounds on the remains, initially seen as contradictory, <c-b>is rationalized by suggesting that</c-b> Richard III’s high-quality armor effectively protected him from severe injuries that would leave permanent marks on his bones. (分点论述) <c-b>These points collectively reinforce the possibility that</c-b> the remains could indeed belong to Richard III. (总结)</p>

<p>Personal relationships <strong>have a more profound impact on</strong> happiness <strong>than</strong> career satisfaction. (观点句)
Human beings are inherently social creatures, and our well-being significantly depends on the quality of relationships we maintain with family and friends. These connections offer emotional support, enrich our lives with meaningful interactions, and provide a sense of belonging that is crucial for mental health. (陈述观点)
<strong>While</strong> a fulfilling career can contribute to a sense of purpose and achievement, it is the warmth and security of personal relationships that sustain us through life&rsquo;s challenges. Positive interactions with loved ones stimulate happiness and resilience, making us feel valued and understood. <strong>In contrast</strong>, success in the workplace often demands sacrifices in personal time and relationships, which can lead to isolation and stress.

For example, some educators think that by focusing mainly on foundational knowledge in subjects like reading, math, and science, schools are not fully preparing students for success in the workplace. These educators argue that soft skills-non academic skills such as <u-b>empathetic 善解人意</u-b> or having a strong work ethic-should be part of the curriculum, with classroom time dedicated to developing these skills. Do you agree? Why or why not?</td>

<td style="text-align:left">I agree. While students need a strong foundation in academic subjects, soft skills are important because they affect how well students do their work. If classroom time is set aside for these skills, students will take them seriously and their academic work will benefit. Teachers could design lessons so that students learn about a skill and then do role-playing activities with classmates.</td>

<td style="text-align:left">Soft skills are important, but I don&rsquo;t agree with using classroom time to work on them. I&rsquo;m not sure how teachers would measure students&rsquo; progress in developing these skills. If students&rsquo; progress can&rsquo;t be measured on something being taught, I&rsquo;m not sure if there&rsquo;s any point to teaching it.</td>

<p>Incorporating soft skills into the educational curriculum is essential for preparing students for real-world challenges.
<strong>I concur with</strong> Claire&rsquo;s viewpoint that, alongside academic proficiency, soft skills such as empathy, teamwork, and work ethic play a pivotal role in a student&rsquo;s overall success.
By allocating classroom time to these skills, schools can ensure that students <strong>not only</strong> understand their importance <strong>but also</strong> have the opportunity to practice and refine them in a structured setting.
Role-playing activities, group projects, and reflective discussions are practical methods through which these skills can be developed and assessed.
<strong>Moreover</strong>, integrating soft skills training does not detract from academic learning; instead, it complements it by enhancing students&rsquo; ability to communicate, collaborate, and solve problems effectively.
These are the competencies that employers consistently seek, and by addressing them within the school curriculum, educators can provide a more holistic education that equips students for both professional and personal success.</p>

<td style="text-align:left">This week we will discuss issues faced by secondary school administrators. I&rsquo;m referring to schools for teenage students. One such issue is <u-b>students who change schools</u-b>. Students change schools for many different reasons, the most common being a family move. On the discussion board, I want you to exchange ideas about <strong>what schools can do to make the transition to a new school easier for teenagers</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Claire</td>
<td style="text-align:left">I think schools should assign new students a fellow student who can help them adjust. The &ldquo;student buddy&rdquo; can do things like make sure the new student can find the cafeteria or the right classrooms. For new students, it&rsquo;s a lot easier to ask a fellow student a question rather than ask a teacher or the principal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Paul</td>
<td style="text-align:left">I would require new students to sign up for some school club or activity that meets outside of class. That way, new students would have an easy way to meet other students in a friendly environment. lt would give them a group to immediately identify with.</td>

参考范文：
<p>To facilitate a smooth transition for transfer students, schools should implement a buddy system, pairing new students with current ones.
This strategy, as suggested by Claire, offers personalized support that can significantly ease the stress of adapting to a new environment.
The student buddy, being familiar with the school&rsquo;s layout and culture, can provide invaluable guidance, from locating classrooms and the cafeteria to understanding school norms and procedures.
This peer-to-peer approach fosters a welcoming atmosphere, making new students feel more comfortable and less isolated.
<strong>Additionally</strong>, it encourages the development of friendships and social connections, which are crucial for emotional and academic well-being. Teachers and school administrators, while supportive, may not always be approachable or available for every small query a new student might have.
<strong>In contrast</strong>, a student buddy, being a peer, is more relatable and accessible, making it easier for new students to seek help and advice.
This system not only benefits the new students but also cultivates a sense of community and responsibility among existing students, enriching the school&rsquo;s overall environment.</p>

<td style="text-align:left">This week we talked about how important taking time off from work or school is for people&rsquo;s well-being. Some people believe they get the most benefit when that time off is structured: that is it involves planning in advance about what will be accomplished on that day. Others believe it is better to enjoy the day with no plan for how to spend it. In this discussion post please indicate which of those approaches to spending time off from work on school you prefer and why?</td>

<td style="text-align:left">I find it beneficial to do some advance planning for my free time.

<td style="text-align:left">Personally, I prefer not to make any plans for my free time. I go to school, and I have a part-time job each week. I make a schedule to be sure I can complete both my work and studies. So when I have time off from work and school, I just want to relax with no plan.</td>

参考范文：
<p>Planning our leisure time in advance can significantly enhance the quality of our breaks, offering a structured opportunity to rejuvenate and connect with loved ones.
For individuals like Claire, who live far from family, meticulously scheduling visits during holidays ensures that every moment is maximized.
This approach to planning not only guarantees quality time with each family member but also relieves the stress of last-minute arrangements.
<strong>By anticipating these gatherings</strong>, individuals can better balance their personal and professional commitments, making the most out of their free time.
<strong>Furthermore</strong>, planned breaks can cater to personal growth activities, such as pursuing a hobby or learning a new skill, which might require booking resources or classes ahead of time.
<strong>Therefore</strong>, pre-planning leisure time is not about restricting spontaneity but ensuring that our limited free time is spent in the most fulfilling way possible.</p>
