<li>人类语言的特点：语言 (language) 是一种人类特有交流方式的，而动物通过交流系统 (communication system)进
行沟通。与交流系统相比，人类语言有3个独特之处：
<ul>
<li>学习能力(learn ability) , 语言是可以通过学习得到的，比如大家在努力学英语；</li>
<li>不连续性(discreteness) , 语言中不连续的单元可以用不同的次序组合，形成不同含义；</li>
<li>位移性(displacement) , 语言可以描述不在此时此地发生的事。</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>语言家族谱系树 (the family tree model)：世界上有超过5000种语言，但是很多语言都有相似之处。例如，闪米特语 (Sanskirt), 拉丁语(Latin) 和希腊语 (Greek), 语言学家认为这三门语言都源自于同一个母语(mother language) —— 原始印欧语(Proto- Indo- European)。</li>
<li>语言学家发展出一种标记语言演化的方法——语言家族谱系树，这种方法形象地展示了语言家族如何发展，两种之间的紧密程度。</li>
<li>格莱斯准则 (Gricean Maxims)：在人们的交流中，有一些基本的原则是不能违背的，这就是格莱斯准则 (Gricean Maxims) 。
<ul>
<li>质量原则(quality) , 不要说假话 ( do not say what you believe to be false);</li>
<li>相关原则(relevance) , 答案要与问题相关，说话者给出暗示 (imply), 听众做出合理推测
(inference);</li>
<li>数量原则(quantity) , 交谈的双方应该给出尽可能多的信息量。

<p>Why does the professor describe a letter of recommendation?</p>
<ul>
<li>To point out differences between written statements and spoken statements</li>
<li>To illustrate how people may be deceived in a business environment</li>
<li><strong>To show how violating a maxim may contribute to a statement&rsquo;s meaning</strong></li>
<li>To prove that lying is sometimes considered acceptable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does the professor imply about advertisers?</p>
<ul>
<li>They are less likely than politicians to violate a Gricean maxim.</li>
<li>They realize that consumers know whether an advertisement violates a maxim.</li>
<li>They often make use of the Gricean maxims to express humor.</li>
<li><strong>They realize that consumers make false inferences from advertisements.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What type of maxim does the professor illustrate with this example: For instance, suppose you say you would really love to have a cup of coffee right now, and I say ‘there’s a shop around the corner’. Now, what can you infer from what I said?</p>

<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">OK, the conventions or assumptions that govern conversation- these may vary from one culture to another, but basically, for people to communicate, there&rsquo;s, uh- they have to follow certain rules. Like, if I&rsquo;m talking with you, and I start saying things that&rsquo;re not true- if you can&rsquo;t tell when I&rsquo;m lying and when I&rsquo;m telling the truth, well, we&rsquo;re not going to have a very&hellip;satisfactory conversation, are we? Why? Because it violates one of the &ldquo;<p-y>Gricean maxims</p-y>&rdquo;.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">That&rsquo;s a set of rules or maxims a philosopher named H. P. Grice came up with in the 1970s. One of these Gricean maxims is&hellip; well, I&rsquo;ve already given you a hint.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Student:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Oh, you just can&rsquo;t go around telling lies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Right-or, as Grice put it, &ldquo;Do not say what you believe to be false. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of Grice&rsquo;s maxims of quality, as he called it. So that&rsquo;s pretty obvious, but there&rsquo;re others just as important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Like, ah, suppose you were to ask me what time it was, and I replied, &ldquo;My sister just got married.&rdquo; What would you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Student:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Uh, you&rsquo;re not really answering my question!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">No, I m not, am I? There&rsquo;s no connection at all, which feels wrong because you generally expect to find one. So one important maxim is simply, &ldquo;Be relevant.&rdquo; And using this so-called maxim of relevance, we can infer things as well- or rather, the speaker can imply things and the listener can make inferences.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">For instance, suppose you say you&rsquo;d really love to have a cup of coffee right now. And I say, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a shop around the corner.&rdquo; Now, what can you infer from what I said?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Student:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Well, that the shop sells coffee, for one thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Right! And that I believe it&rsquo;s open now. Because if I weren&rsquo;t implying those things, my response would not be relevant. It&rsquo;d have no connection with what you said before. But according to the maxim, my response should be relevant to your statement, meaning we should assume some connection between the statement and the response.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">And this maxim of relevance is quite efficient to use; even if I don&rsquo;t spell out all the details, you can still make some useful logical inferences, namely &ldquo;the shop is open&rdquo; and &ldquo;it sells coffee.&rdquo; If we actually had to explain all these details, conversations would move along pretty slowly, wouldn&rsquo;t they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">OK, then there&rsquo;s the maxims of manner, including things like &ldquo;Be clear&rdquo; and &ldquo;Avoid ambiguity.&rdquo; And another, more interesting maxim is one of the so-called maxims of quantity- quantity of information, that is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">It says to give as much information as is required in the situation. So suppose you ask me what I did yesterday and I say, &ldquo;I went to the art museum.&rdquo; You would likely infer that I saw some works of art. Suppose though that I did not go inside the museum, I just walked up to it, then left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Then I&rsquo;ve violated the quantity maxim by not giving enough information. So you can see how important implications are to our ability to carry on a conversation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">But there are times when people will violate these maxims on purpose. Let&rsquo;s say a boss is asked to write a letter of recommendation for a former employee seeking an engineering job. The letter he writes is quite brief- something like, uh, Mr. X is polite and always dresses neatly. So what does this really mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Student:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Oh, I see. By not mentioning any important qualities related to the job, the boss is, like, implying that this is the best that can be said about Mr. X- that he&rsquo;s really not qualified.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Exactly. It&rsquo;s a written letter, not a conversation, but the principle&rsquo;s the same. The boss is conveying a negative impression of Mr. X without actually saying anything negative about him.</td>
</tr>

<td style="text-align:left">professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">One of the things New York City is known for is its Broadway theaters—big productions, elaborate <u-r>musicals 音乐剧</u-r>. A lot of money goes into producing a musical—with the actors, costumes, scenery… and so on—the shows are designed to appeal to large audiences, to make the production financially <u-r>viable 可行的，能养活的</u-r>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">But theater didn’t always appeal to the masses. In the middle of the nineteenth century, it was mostly wealthy residents who were going to Broadway—they would see an opera that was probably written and produced in Europe before making its way over to New York.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">It was a scene for, uh, well… the socially <u-r>prominent</u-r>, the upper class—who attended these functions perhaps because they felt <u-b>obligated 有责任的</u-b> rather than because of a <u-r>genuine interest</u-r> in theater.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">But, in the 1860s, something else started to occur: the middle-class population began to grow—and they were looking for a source of entertainment. Keep that in mind while I talk about a theater owner named William Wheatley.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">In 1866, William Wheatley had this show, uh… and it was different from most shows on Broadway at the time because it wasn’t an opera. And, it was developed right here in the United States… in English, unlike the operas, which were typically in Italian or French.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Wheatley also decided to incorporate some fancy production techniques—<strong>stage effects</strong>. The show also included music to make it more entertaining. And, through <u-r>a stroke of luck 机缘巧合</u-r>, <u-r>a world-renowned ballet troupe 歌舞团</u-r> became available just as Wheatley’s show was about to open, so he didn’t hesitate to include the ballet dancers in his production.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Along the lines of those special effects I mentioned, Wheatley redesigned the entire stage for this show: every <u-r>floorboard</u-r> on the stage could be lifted up or pushed down—they were all moveable. This allowed for trap doors to be placed anywhere on the stage, so pieces of the set—uh, of the scenery—could easily be stored beneath the stage… and these trap doors also gave performers another, less traditional way to enter and exit the stage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">While today we might <u-r>not think much of it 不以为然</u-r>—things like this are standard nowadays—the concept was quite novel at the time of Wheatley’s show… and was one of the things that made the show a hit with audiences.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Another innovative element in the show was a scene called the “transformation scene.” During this scene, the audience watched in <u-r>amazement</u-r> as the setting on stage changed from a <u-r>moonlit 月光</u-r> cave to a throne room in a palace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Normally to have this type of major scene change, the <u-r>curtains</u-r> would close, the stage crew would remove the previous set and replace it with the new one, and then the curtains would open again. In this instance, though, the transformation took place in front of the audience using simple machinery.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">And this effect… it left a lasting impression on everyone who saw Wheatley’s production. In fact, those people were probably disappointed when they saw another show that didn’t contain something as, well… as elaborate or exciting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">So look, when it <u-r>premiered 首映</u-r>, Wheatley’s show took audiences by surprise… it appealed to large crowds, including the growing middle class. The show ran for almost two years straight in New York City, an achievement unheard of at a time when productions typically lasted weeks or months—not years.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">It also went on tour, visiting different cities across the United States for over 25 years. So… the show was quite a success.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">And with all that in mind, some people call Wheatley’s show the first musical on Broadway. Now, our current definition of a musical is that it tells a story through dialogue and song. In Wheatley’s show, the musical sections, well, they didn’t necessarily integrate well with the story, giving an overall impression of something more like a <u-r>variety show 综艺节目</u-r>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Yes, everything was loosely focused around a central theme… so maybe it’s fair to say, then, that this show gave audiences a hint of a new form of musical theater that would ultimately appear on Broadway in the decades to follow.</td>

<td style="text-align:left">OK, as art historians, one of our fundamental tasks is to assign <u-r>authorship</u-r> to works of art, right? We&rsquo;re presented with a work of art, and we have to figure out who made it.

Emily.</td>

<td style="text-align:left">Student:</td>

<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Well, <u-r>you&rsquo;re sort of on the right track 有点对路了</u-r>. The concept of the individual artist-especially the concept of the artist as an artistic genius, bleh, struggling alone with a <u-r>vision 远见</u-r>&hellip; as opposed to, say, <u-r>a mere artisan</u-r>-well the idea of the artist as a lone genius didn&rsquo;t develop until later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">But artists, individual artists, did sign their work during the Renaissance. In fact, you could say that&rsquo;s part of the problem&hellip;Paintings were signed by the artist, and that used to be understood to be a mark of Renaissance <u-r>individualism</u-r>.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">If a piece had <u-r>Raphael 拉斐尔</u-r>&rsquo;s signature on it, we assumed it was done by the great artist himself-Raphael, in the <u-r>singular</u-r>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">But you see, art in Renaissance Italy was very much a collaborative business. Painters and sculptors worked in a <u-r>workshop</u-r>. It was almost like a small business run by&hellip;a master artist. You see, to deal with the wide variety of commissions they received-orders, basically, for specific types of art, specific projects-to handle these, master artists often employed assistants, as <u-r>apprentices 学徒工</u-r>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">An-and this was especially so if they worked on a large scale, huge paintings or sculptures, or if they were much in demand, like Raphael for instance. He worked on some large paintings: He painted <u-r>frescoes 壁画</u-r> for the <u-r>Vatican</u-r>. He also received a great many commissions. There&rsquo;s no way he could have completed every part of every project all by himself!</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Now, these assistants might work for the master artist on a temporary or a permanent basis, and they might also specialize.

<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">He actually painted a good number of the animals in Raphael&rsquo;s art. It may be that a master signing a work was simply making a <u-r>declaration</u-r> that the work met the standards of the shop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">And it wasn&rsquo;t just painters. Sculptors also worked together; in fact, assistants were even more necessary if you were a master sculptor, because statues take longer to make than paintings. And the master had to arrange for marble to be <u-r>quarried 开采矿石</u-r>, things like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Perhaps the most collaborative of all was architecture. There we see a real division of labor, what with <u-r>carpenters 木匠</u-r>, <u-r>masons 泥瓦匠</u-r>, unskilled labor just to carry materials to and fro, and so on. Plus, of course, your skilled artisans, who carried out the master architect&rsquo;s design.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Think of it like, uh, a ballet, you know? All the dancers work together. There&rsquo;s a division of labor, people have different roles, and in order for the thing to come together, everyone needs to be aware of what others are doing, and coordinate their work, and have good timing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">So for architecture, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to know who was responsible for any given detail.Was it the master architect? The mason? An assistant mason? Maybe it was even the <u-r>patron 赞助人，顾客</u-r>, the client who was paying for the art.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Remember, it wasn&rsquo;t yet <u-r>customary 习俗</u-r> for architects to give their assistants <u-r>measured drawings 测量图纸</u-r> to work from. Instructions were given orally, not in writing, so we don&rsquo;t have those documents to tell us what, exactly, the master architect&rsquo;s plans were.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">The only time we have written records is when the architect wasn&rsquo;t actually there-perhaps the architect was away on business, and had to write out instructions and send them to the shop.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">And another thing to think about: what effect do you suppose this approach would have had on innovation? I mean, since the hired artisans had been trained by other artisans, they tended to be trained to use traditional styles and techniques.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">So if you&rsquo;re a master architect, um, and you&rsquo;ve developed your own style-say you&rsquo;re calling for a certain detail in a building you&rsquo;re designing, right?

<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Well, most likely, when the hired artisans would execute the design, rather than follow the intended design, they&rsquo;d <u-r>stick with 坚持</u-r> the more traditional style that they were familiar with.

<li>中世纪诗歌 (Medieval poetry)：香颂(Chanson)是一种中世纪(Medieval)诗歌，曾经在欧洲，特别是法国十分流行。香颂为骑士(knight)和领主(lord)所创作，由游吟诗人(minstrel) 传唱，描述骑士们的英雄事迹(heroic deeds),歌颂骑士的英勇(bravery)和忠诚(loyalty),让骑士和领主认为爱国行为(patriotism)是高尚(noble)的。</li>
<li>浪漫诗歌 (Romance Poetry)：浪漫诗歌出现的比香颂更晚。浪漫诗歌中描写的骑士是孤独的(solitary) , 在诗歌中描述了骑士的内心情感(inner feelings)—— 骑士努力完善自己，证明自己值得女士的青睐。</li>

<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Alright, so now we&rsquo;ve talked about <p-y>folk legends</p-y>, and seen that they&rsquo;re, that one of their key features is, there&rsquo;s usually some real history behind them. They&rsquo;re often about real people. So you can identify with the characters. And that&rsquo;s what engages us in them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">The particular stories might not be true, and some of the characters or events might be made up, but there&rsquo;s still a sense that the story could have been true, since it&rsquo;s about a real person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">That&rsquo;s a distinct contrast from the other main branch of popular storytelling, which is <p-y>folktales</p-y>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Folktales are imaginative stories that um, like folk legends, they&rsquo;ve been passed down orally, from storyteller to storyteller, for, since ancient times. But with folktales, you don&rsquo;t ever really <u-r>get the sense</u-r> that the story might have been true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">They&rsquo;re purely imaginative, and so quite <u-r>revealing</u-r>- I think, anyway- about the culture, and uh, the connection between folktales and the culture, which we&rsquo;ll talk about. But first let&rsquo;s go over the various types of folktale, and focus specifically on Norwegian folktales since they illustrate the variety pretty well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">There are, in general, <p-y>three main types of Norwegian folktales</p-y>. One is <strong>animal stories</strong>, where animals are the main characters. They can be wild animals or uh, <u-r>domestic</u-r>, and a lot of times they can talk and behave like humans, but at the same time they retain their animal characteristics too. They tend to involve animals like bears, wolves, and foxes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">The point of these stories, their, their internal objective, so to speak, is usually to <u-b>explain some feature of the animal, how it arose</u-b>. So there&rsquo;s one about a fox who <u-r>fools</u-r> a bear into going ice fishing with his tail. When the bear puts his tail into the water through a hole in the ice, to try to catch a fish, the ice freezes around it, and he ends up pulling his tail off!So that&rsquo;s why bears to this day have such short tails.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">The second category of Norwegian folktale is the <u-r>supernatural</u-r>. Uh, stories about, giants and dragons and <u-r>trolls</u-r>, and humans with supernatural powers or gifts. Like invisibility cloaks. Or where people are turned into animals and back again into a person. Those are called transformation stories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">There&rsquo;s a well-known Norwegian supernatural folktale, a transformation story called &ldquo;East of the Sun and West of the Moon&rdquo;. Which we&rsquo;ll read. It involves a prince who&rsquo;s a white bear by night and a human by day. And he lives in a castle that&rsquo;s east of the Sun and west of the Moon- which the <u-r>heroine</u-r> of the story has to try to find.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Besides being a good example of a transformation story, this one also has a lot of the common things that tend to show up in folktales. You&rsquo;ll find the standard opening &ldquo;Once upon a time&hellip;,&rdquo;.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">And it has stock characters like a prince and a poor but beautiful <u-r>peasant</u-r> girl, she&rsquo;s the heroine I mentioned. And um&hellip; it has a very conventional form, so no more than two characters are involved in any one scene. And it has a happy ending.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">And it&rsquo;s, the story is presented as though, well, even though a lot of the actions that occur are pretty fantastic,so you&rsquo;d never think of it as realistic, the characters still act like, they <u-r>resemble</u-r> real people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">They&rsquo;re not real, or even based on historical figures-but you might have a supernatural story involving a king, and he&rsquo;d act like you&rsquo;d expect a Norwegian king to act.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Ok, the third main kind of folktale is the comical story. We&rsquo;ll say more later about these but for now, just be aware of the category and that they can contain supernatural aspects, but they&rsquo;re usually more playful and amusing overall than supernatural stories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Now, as I said, traditionally folktales were just passed down orally. Each generation of storytellers had their own style of telling a story. But um&hellip; in Norway, before the nineteenth century, folktales were just for kids, they weren&rsquo;t seen as worthy of analysis or academic attention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">But this changed when the <u-r>Romantic movement</u-r> spread throughout Europe in the mid-nineteenth century. The romantics looked at folktales as sort of a reflection of the soul of the people, so there was something distinctly Norwegian in folktales from Norway. And there was <u-r>renewed</u-r> pride in the literature and art forms of individual countries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">As a result, the first collection of Norwegian folktales was published in 1852. And there&rsquo;ve been many new editions published since then. For the people of Norway, these stories are now an important part of what it means to be Norwegian.</td>
