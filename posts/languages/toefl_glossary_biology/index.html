            <div class="admonition-content"><p>Biological invasions by exotic species are an <u-r>escalating</u-r> threat to biodiversity around the globe.
Invasive species can displace native ones and <u-r>irrevocably</u-r> alter ecosystems.
Most imported species either die or have limited growth in their new home, but a small percentage of the newcomers are opportunists whose growth is dangerously out of control.
The story of how Caulerpa taxifolia became famous as one of these species began in 1989, when Dr. Alexandre Meinesz, a marine biologist at the University of Nice in France, learned that this exotic alga, which is native to the <u-g>Caribbean</u-g> and other tropical seas, was thriving in the <u-g>Mediterranean</u-g> waters off the coast of Monaco.
Upon investigation, Meinesz discovered that a mutant variety of C. taxifolia was dumped into the Mediterranean with other <u-r>aquarium</u-r> refuse by the prestigious Oceanographic Institute of Monaco.
Eventually, the C. taxifolia was traced back to a stock developed at the Wilhelma Zoological and Botanical Gardens in Stuttgart, Germany.
This stock of C. taxifolia had caught the attention of amateur and professional aquarists for its exceptional beauty and hardiness and had been widely distributed in public and private <u-r>aquaria</u-r> in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Instead of dying in the cold winter waters of the Mediterranean Sea as the tropical variety of C. taxifolia does, the mutant variety can withstand several months at temperatures that range between 10° and 13° C.
In addition, the alga grows equally well on a variety of ocean substrates—sand, mud, or rocks—and from near the surface to depths of 50 meters.
When temperatures exceed 18°C, the mutant Caulerpa grows at a remarkable rate, capable of elongating by 2 centimeters in a single day and forming a new frond every 2 days.
A single square meter of seafloor can be matted with 5,500 leafy <u-r>fronds</u-r>.
All of this growth is <u-r>asexual</u-r>.
Unlike the tropical form, the mutated form of C. taxifolia produces only male <u-r>gametes</u-r> in the Mediterranean and thus replicates only by fragmentation.
Just a small piece can regenerate and colonize an area.
In fact, it is believed that fishing nets and boat anchors as well as the ripping action of storms have helped the alga spread to new areas.</p>
<p>With such a rapid rate of growth, the Mediterranean Caulerpa grows quickly over the sea bottom, blanketing all other sea life such as marine <u-r>angiosperms</u-r>, native algae, corals, and <u-r>sea fans</u-r>.
lt cuts off vital essentials such as sunlight for photosynthesis and currents for filter feeding of nutrients.
The area becomes a Caulerpa <u-g>lawn</u-g> while species diversity is lost.
In addition, C, taxifolia is inedible to most marine <u-r>herbivores</u-r> because of the presence of toxic compounds, primarily caulerpenyne.
With no <u-r>predator</u-r> to inhibit its phenomenal growth, the alga had encompassed the Mediterranean coasts of Monaco, France, Italy, Spain, and the Croatian coast on the Adriatic Sea covering 30,000 hectares by 2002.
Caulerpa <u-r>infestations</u-r> have also been found in southern Australia, in estuaries near Sydney and Adelaide.</p>
<p>Various methods have been tried to eradicate this deadly invader.
Divers have been employed to rip the alga out by hand, but care must be taken because even a small fragment is capable of colonizing new areas.
Black plastic tarps have been placed over the alga in an attempt to deprive it of life-giving sunlight.
Chemicals such as copper, a conventional <u-r>algicide</u-r>, and toxic levels of salt have also been applied to Caulerpa fields.
There has been limited success but only if the area of invasion is small.</p>
<p>One hopeful avenue is biological control.
In biological control, a disease or predator of the invasive organism is introduced and allowed to destroy it.
In the native range of the tropical C. taxiolie, two species of sea slug are immune to its poisons and feed on the alga <strong>exclusively</strong>.
They suck the cytoplasm out of the leaves and incorporate the algal <u-r>chloroplasts</u-r>, the part of the plant that contains green photosynthetic pigment, into their skin. [█]
The chloroplasts provide camouflage as the snails feed in the Caulerpa fields and, surprisingly, continue to photosynthesize, providing additional nutrition for the slugs. [█]
Dr. Meinesz is suggesting the importation of these slugs to the Mediterranean as the only way to eliminate the <u-r><strong>immense</strong></u-r> area that Caulerpa now covers. [█]
But many experts fear that another exotic importation may lead to more environmental damage. [√]</p>

<li>
<p>According to paragraph 1, what event first caused Caulerpa taxifolia to become publicly known as a damaging species?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marine biologist Alexandre Meinesz identified a variety of C. taxiolia growing in the Mediterranean near Monaco</strong></li>
<li>The Oceanographic Institute of Monaco disposed of a variety of C. taxiolia in the Mediterranean</li>
<li>The Wilhelma Zoological and Botanical Gardens developed a new variety of C. taxifolia</li>
<li>A variety of C. taxifolia became widely distributed in public and private aquaria</li>

        <div class="details-content">
            <div class="admonition-content"><p>Some of <u-r>the least costly defenses</u-r>, in terms of energy use, available to plants are structures that make <u-r>penetration</u-r> by predators difficult, if not impossible. These include tough leaves, <u-r>spines</u-r>, and <u-r>epidermal</u-r> hairs on leaves, which may trap, <u-r>impale</u-r>, or fence out insects and discourage browsing by vertebrate herbivores, as well as hard-coated seeds. These structures may have evolved early in the history of the plants, when they might have <u-b>been subject to</u-b> even greater predatory pressures. Because they represent little investment, plants still <strong>retain</strong> them.</p>
<p>Many seeds have thick, hard seed coats that provide protection from seed-eating animals.
The problem with such seed defense is that the seeds need to be scarified—the hard seed needs <u-r>scratching or scoring of the seed coat</u-r> to weaken it—so the seedling itself can escape.
If the seed is not scarified, the <u-r>seedling</u-r> embryo is sealed in, never to <u-r>germinate</u-r>.
Many plants, however, have turned seed <u-r>predation</u-r> into a mechanism for seed dispersal, such as the transport and caching of seeds by squirrels, <u-r>jays</u-r>, mice, and ants.</p>
<p>The role of structural defenses in plants was largely presumed until experimental evidence was sought to demonstrate the effectiveness of such apparent defensive structures against <u-r>grazing</u-r> herbivores.
Researchers investigated experimentally the effects of plant <u-r>spinescence</u-r> on the feeding habits of three large <u-r>browsing</u-r> mammalian herbivores of Africa.
These were the <p-y>kudu</p-y>, a large African <u-r>antelope</u-r> attaining a female body weight of 180 kilograms; the <p-y>impala</p-y>, a medium-sized African antelope attaining a female body weight of 50 kg; and the <p-y>Boer goat</p-y>, a domestic <u-r>ungulate</u-r> weighing about 35 kg.
The experimenters hand <u-r>reared</u-r> the antelope from <u-r>calves</u-r> to allow observation of feeding habits from very close range, 1 to 5 meters, under natural conditions, to determine biting rates the animals employed.
They converted the bites to <u-r>dry biomass</u-r> by collecting samples of leaves and <u-r>shoots</u-r> of a size similar to those eaten and drying them to a constant weight. They calculated eating rate as the product of bite size (dry mass) and biting rate.</p>
<p>Another one of their experiments involved a detailed study to examine the influence of spinescence.
They selected ten plants each of five species of trees at a height accessible to <u-r>impalas</u-r> outside the <u-r>enclosure</u-r>.
The woody plants exhibited <u>three basic types of spinescence</u> <strong>:</strong> paired <u-r>prickles</u-r> or <u-r>thorns</u-r> situated in or close to the leaf <u-r>axils</u-r> <strong>;</strong> short, sharp-tipped <u-r>branchlets</u-r> or spines, sometimes carrying small leaves <strong>;</strong> and prickles of various kinds on leaves.
Thorns were either straight and long, up to 70 millimeters, or short and sharply curved (<u-r>hooked</u-r>). On each tree, two branches were matched for size, shape, density of leaf cover, and ease of access to impalas. These paired branches were labeled and the thorns were removed from one of the branches in each pair. Two months later, researchers visually estimated the relative loss of <u-r>foliage</u-r> from browsing.</p>
<p>Results clearly showed that <p-g>thorns and spines affected the feeding behavior of the three ungulates</p-g>.
These structures restricted bite sizes to mostly single leaves or leaf clusters, and hooked thorns <strong><u-r>retarded</u-r></strong> biting rates.
Acceptability of leaves of those plant species offering small leaf size along with prickles was lower, at least for kudu, than those of other <u-r>palatable</u-r> plant species.
The inhibitory effect of prickles was greater for impalas and goats than for kudu, which bit off the shoot ends in spite of the prickles.
For certain straight-thorned species, kudu compensated partially for their slow eating rates by spending more time gathering the leaves.
Most spinescent species were similar to unarmed palatable species in their acceptability to the ungulates, even though the armed species had a higher <u-r>crude</u-r> protein to their foliage. Probably these spinescent species, especially species of Acacia plants, would be preferred over unarmed species but for the thorns.</p>
<p>[█] The main effect of these armed structural defense features is to restrict bite size, thus increasing handling time.
Thorns, spines, and prickles restrict foliage losses to large herbivores. [√]
In addition, the animals may <u-r>incur scar tissue</u-r> in the <u-r>esophagus</u-r> and <u-r>scratches</u-r> in the mouth and throat. [█]
These experiments show that at least in some cases structural plant defenses are effective at protecting plants. [█]</p>

        </div>
        <div class="details-content">
            <div class="admonition-content"><p>The earliest-known horse fossils come from the <u-g>Eocene</u-g> epoch (from 57 to 34 million years ago), and they are so different from the modern version that it was not initially realized that there was any relation.
Dawn horse, or <p-y>Eohippus</p-y>, as this animal has been called, has been found in both Europe and North America.
Eohippus was tiny, about the size of a small dog, and apparently lived in wooded areas.
These animals had <u-r>hooves</u-r> but, in contrast to modern horses, they had four <u-r>hoofed</u-r> toes on the front feet, three on the <u-r>rear</u-r>, and the hooves were <u-r>padded</u-r>.
Eohippus was also pug-nosed by comparison to modern horses, and its teeth reveal that it was a browser that fed on a variety of plants.
In fact, although it was completely herbivorous (plant eating), this little horse had <u-r>canine</u-r> teeth—a reminder that many of its <u-r>predecessors</u-r> were <u-r>carnivores</u-r> (meat eaters).</p>
<p>Throughout the Eocene and <u-g>Oligocene</u-g> epochs (from 57 to 23 million years ago), the <u-g>descendants</u-g> of Eohippus evolved in a fairly straightforward way that is well documented by their <p-g>fossils</p-g>.
They became gradually larger; the middle toe, eventually to become the single hoof of the modern horses, became stronger and more <u-r>prominent</u-r>, and the <u-r>grinding</u-r> surfaces of the teeth became larger, with complex, resistant <u-r>ridges</u-r>.
But the <u-g>resemblance to</u-g> Eohippus remained clear.
It was only in the <u-g>Miocene</u-g> (from 23 to 5 million years ago), coincident with the spread of grassy <u-r>prairies</u-r>, that abrupt changes took place, resulting in several different lineages of horse evolution, only one of which is still <u-r>extant</u-r>: the modern horse.</p>
<p>Several of the physical characteristics of today’s animals are ultimately linked to their diet of grasses. [█]
Foremost among the Miocene modifications that led toward present-day horses were changes in the teeth and the shape of the head. [█]
Compared to the <u-r>succulent</u-r> leaves of tropical trees that were the <u-r>fodder</u-r> for some of the horse’s ancestors, grasses are <u-r>abrasive</u-r> and much more difficult to chew and <u-r>grind</u-r>. [√]
The response of the Miocene horses was to develop teeth with much <strong>more <u-g>elaborate</strong></u-g> and resistant grinding surfaces and with much larger <u-r>crowns</u-r>, at least part of which could grow out of the gums as they were worn down. [█]
These changes meant that the head had to be much deeper, and the <u-r>muzzle</u-r> longer, to make room for the long rows of grinding teeth along the horse’s cheeks.
At about the same time, the legs and feet of the ancestors of today’s horses became better adapted to rapid running across the spreading grasslands.
This occurred through fusion of several of the independent bones in the lower parts of the legs, making them stiffer, and through further emphasis of the central hoofed toe, which by now bore the entire weight of the animal.
In place of a foot, the horse has a single toe at the end of its leg.</p>
<p>By the middle or late Miocene, many of the extant horses were at least <u-g>superficially</u-g> similar to modern horses.
Based on the <p-g>fossil</p-g> record, much of their development seems to have occurred in North America, but by the <u-g>Pleistocene</u-g> epoch (from 1.6 million to 10,000 years ago), the modern horse genus, Equus, had spread over much of the world.
Then, <u-g>inexplicably</u-g>, only 8,000 to 10,000 years ago, horses disappeared from North America.
The reason for this extinction is unknown.
<strong>Whatever the cause, it is a fact that the plains of North America were without these animals for thousands of years, until horses brought from Europe by the early Spanish explorers escaped and began to repopulate the vast grasslands.</strong></p>
<p>It is clear that many of the familiar features of the modern horse are directly or indirectly related to its diet and its preferred environment, grasslands.
But how and why did the grasslands develop when they did?
There are competing theories on this question, but only a few are consistent with the evidence.
Most of these invoke a change in global climate as an important factor, perhaps the <strong>overriding</strong> factor.
In particular, grasslands expanded rapidly as the climate in continental interiors became cooler and drier.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In paragraph 1, why does the author mention that Eohippus had canine teeth?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To make the point that Eohippus evolved from ancestors with a diet different from that of Eohippus</strong></li>
<li>To explain why Eohippus’ teeth were so similar to those of its predecessors</li>
<li>To show why scientists believe that Eohippus was exclusively herbivorous</li>
<li>To argue that physical features that originally evolved to serve one purpose can later serve a different purpose</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paragraph 2 supports which of the following claims about the evolution of the horse?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The ancestors of the modern horse changed more dramatically in the Miocene than in the earlier Eocene and Oligocene epochs.</strong></li>
<li>Most lineages of the modern horse that survived the Eocene and Oligocene epochs became extinct during the Miocene epoch.</li>
<li>During the Eocene and Oligocene epochs, the horse lost all but the middle toe on each foot.</li>
<li>There is little fossil evidence of how horses evolved during the Miocene epoch.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Eohippus began to be called dawn horse, after its relationship to the modern horse was established through fossil evidence.</li>
<li><strong>During the Eocene and Oligocene epochs, the descendants of the Eohippus began to develop some of the characteristics associated with the modern horse.</strong></li>
<li><strong>By the end of the Pleistocene, the modern horse, Equus, had spread over much of the world but for reasons that are unclear, it disappeared from the plains of North America for thousands of years.</strong></li>
<li>By the end of the Eocene epoch, Eohippus’ nose had slowly developed into a long muzzle, and the four toes on its front feet had disappeared.</li>
<li><strong>As grasslands expanded in the Miocene, horses changed abruptly in ways that made their relationship to modern horses more apparent and developed several lineages.</strong></li>
<li>Several theories about the development of grasslands have answered most questions about the evolution of Eohippus and its descendants.</li>

<td style="text-align:left">Termites, insect <u-r>order Isoptera</u-r>. Hard to think of them as more than just <u-r>pests</u-r> that want to eat your house, but I think you’ll be surprised at how interesting they are and how important they are to the ecosystem. Now what do you already know about them?</td>

<td style="text-align:left">They eat wood, lots of it.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Teacher:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Right, to be more specific, they eat dead wood, like dead trees in forests and plant <u-r>litter</u-r>. Their consumption of wood is like, you can think of this like recycling. Termites are recycling that litter back into soil. Their major source of nutrition comes from <u-r>cellulose</u-r>, the main chemical ingredient of wood and the cell walls of other plants, leaves, grasses, etc.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Teacher:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Now cellulose is a complex sugar. And most termites can’t actually digest it because they don’t have the right enzyme to <u-r>metabolize</u-r> it, to release its <u-r>nutritional benefit</u-r>.  Now that would be a problem, but they have a special relationship with <u-r>protozoa</u-r> and bacteria that actually live in their digestive system.</td>

<td style="text-align:left">Teacher:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Yes. It’s these microscopic organisms that break down the cellulose for the termites. They’d <u-r>starve</u-r> without them. A good example of…</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Teacher:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Good. What else is interesting? Termites are social. They live in colonies like ants or bees. Now about the colonies. Each termite colony is founded by a male and female pair that mate and produce more termites. The termites in the colony come in several types called <u-r>castes</u-r>. There’s the <u-r>reproductive</u-r> pair, the workers that gather food to feed the colony, and soldiers that defend the colony against predators, like ants. And they communicate by?</td>

<td style="text-align:left">Dancing? Like the dances bees do?</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Teacher:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">You are not too far off. Every colony has its own distinct smell, a scent that other termites within their colony recognize. If a worker finds a new food source, it <u-r>secretes</u-r> a trail of scent that others can follow to locate the food. And scent plays an important role in helping soldiers defend the colony against <u-r>predators</u-r>. If they detect an unfamiliar scent, well, let’s say an ant is <u-r>lurking</u-r> around, well, the ant has a distinct smell. As soon as soldiers detect this ant’s scent, it’s a warning. They shift into an aggressive mode, ready to start defending their colony.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Teacher:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Termites also communicate alarm through sound. If workers or soldiers want to sound the alarm, they’ll bang their heads against the tunnels in their nest. Other termites perceive the <u-r>vibrations</u-r> through special sensory organs on their legs and come running to defend their colony, so they are pretty complex animals. I hope you are getting a sense of that.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Teacher:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Eventually, a colony swarms, oh, sorry, got ahead of myself. Only termites that can reproduce have wings and that’s only so they can fly to a new location, find a mate, and establish a new colony. So eventually these special winged termites fly off in enormous numbers to form new colonies. They break off their wings after they land. In fact, that’s how I knew I had an <u-r>infestation</u-r> in my house a few years ago. Pretty amazing sight. Nothing I ever wanted to see in my house. There were so many wings on the floor and <u-r>windowsills</u-r>. I called an <u-r>exterminator</u-r> of course to get rid of them, but I kind of had mixed feelings about it.</td>

<td style="text-align:left">You are kidding.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Teacher:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">It’s true. You see, the problem with destroying <u-r>termite</u-r> colonies is that they are really so crucial. Remember I said they recycle plant litter? In addition to creating new soil, termites themselves are a major source of food for other organisms, such as <u-r>salamanders</u-r>, frogs, lizards, and birds, which are preyed upon by other organisms. They are part of an ecological cycle. So it has an impact if too many termites are removed from the ecosystem.</td>

<td style="text-align:left">As I was. Which reminds me of an article I wanted to tell you about. Someone recently <u-r>coined a term</u-r>, <u-r>decompiculture</u-r>. And let me write that down. Decompiculture is the idea that humans should <u-r>cultivate</u-r> organisms that can decompose our waste. The professor suggests in this article that we intentionally raise them. Humans create a lot of waste that often gets dumped into <u-r>landfills</u-r> or water sources. It’s really just pollution. Well, this waste can be fed to termites. Waste like…</td>
